# Getting Started with Vite

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

## Available Scripts

**Note: on newer versions of Node, you may run into `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` errors. You may pass the command-line option of `--openssl-legacy-provider` to work around this. Refer to [Node v17 release notes](https://nodejs.org/es/blog/release/v17.0.0/#openssl-3-0).**

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn type-check`

Runs the TypeScript type checker

### `yarn lint`

Runs `eslint` to find and fix any configured linting issues
